Github Rivers Exercise

The purpose of this project is to explore the interactive and communicative possibilities of collaboration efforts through Github. The task is to work in tandem to write a script that would allow historic stream gauge data to be downloaded and organized, and the most current records reported out for a select number of gauge sites in North Carolina to be used to assess the impact of Hurricane Florence.
